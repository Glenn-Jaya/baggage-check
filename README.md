My first php project using only procedural programming, no OO.
I got the "bug" to make it when I made a last minute 8am run in my pajamas to the nearest walmart to buy insect repellant for my parent's trip to cuba.
My reward was a tongue lashing on account of buying the wrong kind and amount and being stressed out if they could even bring it on the plane.
I felt this was a great beginner project that would allow me the oppotunity to have my first experience with a sql database!

Incorporates unit testing and basic CRUD on a sql database.
